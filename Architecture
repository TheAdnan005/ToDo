HTML (index.html)  :

Provides the basic structure of the application
Contains the main container, title, task list, and input section

CSS (style.css)  :

Styles the main container, title, task list, and input section
Ensures a consistent look and feel across the application

JavaScript (script.js)  :

Handles the addition and deletion of tasks
Adds event listeners for the Add button and delete icons

Component Interaction  :

User Interaction: The user interacts with the application through the input box and buttons.
DOM Manipulation: JavaScript dynamically updates the DOM based on user actions, such as adding or deleting tasks.
